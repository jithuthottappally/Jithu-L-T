Aim:
Design and simulate a surveillance system that uses a motion sensor to trigger alerts and record events using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Problem Statement:
Traditional security systems canâ€™t always provide instant alerts or remote monitoring for suspicious movements. This project solves that by automatically detecting motion, activating alarms, and recording footage for safety monitoring.

Scope of the Solution:
The system is suitable for homes, offices, or secured areas. It can be scaled to add more sensors, cameras, or actuators, providing real-time alerts and automated recording through IoT integration.

Software Used: 
Cisco Packet Tracer

Hardware (virtual in simulation):
1.Door 
2.Motion Detector
3.Webcam 
4.Siren 
5.Home Gateway 
6.Tablet
