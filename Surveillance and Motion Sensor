Aim
Design and simulate a surveillance system that uses a motion sensor to trigger alerts and record events using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Problem Statement
Traditional security systems canâ€™t always provide instant alerts or remote monitoring for suspicious movements. This project solves that by automatically detecting motion, activating alarms, and recording footage for safety monitoring.

Scope of the Solution
The system is suitable for homes, offices, or secured areas. It can be scaled to add more sensors, cameras, or actuators, providing real-time alerts and automated recording through IoT integration.

Required Components to Develop Solutions
Software: Cisco Packet Tracer

Hardware (virtual in simulation):
Door
Motion Detector
Webcam
Siren
Home Gateway
Tablet
